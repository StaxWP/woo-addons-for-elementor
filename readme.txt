Beautiful & Fast add-ons for Elementor. Enhance your site building experience with Stax Elementor Addons

== Description ==
Stax Elementor Addons is a very fast and lightweight plugin that adds new widgets and enhancements to existing Elementor.
We use a super modular approach so any CSS or Javascript for a module is added to the page only if you use that widget.
Also you can enable just the modules you want to see and use in the Elementor interface.

Current Elementor add-on widgets:
- **Elementor Slider Widget** - Easily create a content Slider with Title, Subtitle, Description, Image and Button
- **Scroll Top Widget** - Adds a scroll to top button that appears at the bottom of the page when you scroll the page
- **Read More(Expand text) Widget** - Show content that can be extended with the help of a button to show more text.
- **Breadcrumbs Widget** - Automatically generate breadcrumb structure. Can be used in single posts, pages, archives, etc
- **Dropdown Button Widget** - Allows you to have a button with dropdown functionality. Dropdown entries are added and configured from the widget
- **Heading Widget** - Allows you to have a highlight word or phrase in your heading. Define different text color/ background. Also you can add a subtitle, description and separator
- **Button Widget** - Adds Box Shadow on hover option

Current Elementor widget enhancements:
* Accordion - Box shadow, Item Spacing, Item border & Border radius
* Counter - Alignment
* Text Editor - Set a maximum height for the content and make it scrollable

Many more elements and options coming soon...
